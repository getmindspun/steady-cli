# CLI for programmatically maintaining Ghost sites
`steady-cli` is an all-in-one tool for Ghost theme development and maintaining Ghost sites programmatically.

## Benefits
* Create and locally develop a new Ghost theme.
* Maintain your Ghost site programmatically without
having to go back and forth to the Admin UI.
* Easily integrate into an existing build process.

## Prerequisites
* NodeJS/npm
* A existing Ghost site with administrator access 

## Installation
```shell script
npm install -g steady-cli
```

or on a per-project basis:
```shell script
npm install --save-dev steady-cli
```

## Create an integration in your site (for publish)
* Go to the Integration Settings link in your Ghost site and click `Add custom integration`.
* Give the new integration any name you want e.g. Mindspun and hit 'Create'.
* Note the 'Admin API Key' to be used later.

This integration will be used to `publish` your theme to an existing site.

## Usage

### Create a new theme
From an empty directory where you want your setup to live:
```shell script
steady setup
```
The `setup` command will install the following:
* a local version of Ghost
* a new theme under `content/data/ghoststead`

If you want to check your theme into `git` (and you should),
check in the contents of the `content/data/ghoststead` directory only.
i.e. the `ghoststead` directory should be the top level directory in your git repository.

### Start/Stop/Restart Ghost
Start the local version of Ghost that was installed via `setup` by running the command:
```shell script
steady start
```
The `start` command will run a development version of Ghost in the background.
Log files may be found under `content/logs`.

You can stop your Ghost instance via:
```shell script
steady stop
```

Restart Ghost via:
```shell
steady restart
```
If Ghost is not already running, restart just starts Ghost.

### Theme development
In order to develop a new theme,  you have to build it.
Depending on your theme the build may perform many steps but at a minimum it needs
to compile Sass files into css.  `steady-cli` can watch your theme for file changes and
automatically build your theme when something changes.  Run:
```shell script
steady develop
```

The `develop` command runs in the foreground and automatically rebuilds your theme whenever a source file is modified.
You can easily extend this process by adding additional `grunt` tasks in `content/themes/ghoststead/grunfile.js`.

If your theme name changes from the default `ghoststead`, you can add set the new theme name in the `.steadyrc` file via:

```json
{
    "themeName": "mytheme"
}
```
where `mytheme` is replaces by the name of your theme.  Your theme should be located - for instance, checked out if using source control - in `content/themes`
along side the `ghoststead` and `casper` themes.


### Upload a theme
To upload a theme using the steady CLI, you have to create a integration in your site and
set both `siteUrl` and `adminApiKey` in your `.steadyrc` file.  The `.steadyrc` file was automatically
created when running the 'setup' command.  You may recreate the the rc file via:
```
steady initrc
```

Once your `.steadyrc` file is configured, you can upload a built theme via:
```
steady publish
```

This command will upload the zipped theme from your theme's `dist` directory using the configuration
in the theme `package.json` file.

If you want to upload a different theme by its path, you can run:
```shell script
steady publish-theme /path/to/theme.zip
```

*NOTE* None of the above commands will activate the uploaded theme.

### Using a different working directory
By default, the `steady` command uses the current working directory as the location of the Ghost 
installation and tries to find your theme relative to that directory.  In some cases, it may be helpful to run 
`steady` from another directory and reference your local Ghost installation.  One such
example is having a `.steadyrc` file inside of theme that is symbolic linked into `content\themes`.

To run `steady` from a different directory than your Ghost installation specify the working
directory in one of two ways:
* Use the --workdir command line option
* Use specify "workDir" in your `.steadyrc` file.

If both options are used - i.e. you specify workdir on the command line and you have workDir in
your `.steadyrc` file - then the command line option takes precedence and the `.steadyrc` file
option is simply ignored.

### Reset Ghost


The `reset` command will reinitialize the Ghost SQLITE3 database, allowing the owner to go through the setup process again.
Ghost **must** be stopped when running this command.

```shell
steady reset
```

*New in 1.9.0*

### Get help
```shell script
steady --help
````

## Troubleshooting

`Error: Request failed with status code 404`

* Ensure that your site is up and running (common problem when running locally)
* Re-run the command with the verbose `-v` option and ensure all information is correct.

In particular, ensure that the API version is correct. The API version defaults to `v3`
so if you're still on `v2` that API won't yet exist and you'll get a 404 error.

You can specify the API version in the `.steadyrc` file like:
```json
{
    "version": "v2"
}
```


## Roadmap
`steady-cli` will gradually be expanded to handle other aspects of Ghost administration, specifically:

* Download/upload `routes.yaml`
* Download/upload `redirects.json`

Pull requests welcome.
